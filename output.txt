Original Test Document: down  refrigeration technology would quickly be lost  the same
   is true of other organization-dependent technology  and once this
   technology had been lost for a generation or so it would take
   centuries to rebuild it  just as it took centuries to build it the
   first time around  surviving technical books would be few and
   scattered  an industrial society  if built from scratch without
   outside help  can only be built in a series of stages: you need tools
   to make tools to make tools to make tools       a long process of
   economic development and progress in social organization is required 
   and  even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology  there
   is no reason to believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding
   industrial society  the enthusiasm for "progress" is a phenomenon
   particular to the modern form of society  and it seems not to have
   existed prior to the   th century or thereabouts 
   
        in the late middle ages there were four main civilizations that
   were about equally "advanced": europe  the islamic world  india  and
   the far east  china  japan  korea   three of those civilizations
   remained more or less stable  and only europe became dynamic  no one
   knows why europe became dynamic at that time  historians have their
   theories but these are only speculation  at any rate  it is clear that
   rapid development toward a technological form of society occurs only
   under special conditions  so there is no reason to assume that
   long-lasting technological regression cannot be brought about 
   
        would society eventually develop again toward an
   industrial-technological form? maybe  but there is no use in worrying
   about it  since we can't predict or control events     or       years
   in the future  those problems must be dealt with by the people who
   will live at that time 
   
  the danger of leftism
  
   
   
        because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a
   movement  leftists or persons of similar psychological type are often
   unattracted to a rebellious or activist movement whose goals and
   membership are not initially leftist  the resulting influx of leftish
   types can easily turn a non-leftist movement into a leftist one  so
   that leftist goals replace or distort the original goals of the
   movement 
   
        to avoid this  a movement that exalts nature and opposes
   technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid
   all collaboration with leftists  leftism is in the long run
   inconsistent with wild nature  with human freedom and with the
   elimination of modern technology  leftism is collectivist  it seeks to
   bind together the entire world  both nature and the human race  into a
   unified whole  but this implies management of nature and of human life
   by organized society  and it requires advanced technology  you can't
   have a united world without rapid transportation and communication 
   you can't make all people love one another without sophisticated
   psychological techniques  you can't have a "planned society" without
   the necessary technological base  above all  leftism is driven by the
   need for power  and the leftist seeks power on a collective basis 
   through identification with a mass movement or an organization 
   leftism is unlikely ever to give up technology  because technology is
   too valuable a source of collective power 
   
        the anarchist      too seeks power  but he seeks it on an
   individual or small-group basis  he wants individuals and small groups
   to be able to control the circumstances of their own lives  he opposes
   technology because it makes small groups dependent on large
   organizations 
   
        some leftists may seem to oppose technology  but they will oppose
   it only so long as they are outsiders and the technological system is
   controlled by non-leftists  if leftism ever becomes dominant in
   society  so that the technological system becomes a tool in the hands
   of leftists  they will enthusiastically use it and promote its growth 
   in doing this they will be repeating a pattern that leftism has shown
   again and again in the past  when the bolsheviks in russia were
   outsiders  they vigorously opposed censorship and the secret police 
   they advocated self-determination for ethnic minorities  and so forth 
   but as soon as they came into power themselves  they imposed a tighter
   censorship and created a more ruthless secret police than any that had
   existed under the tsars  and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least
   as much as the tsars had done  in the united states  a couple of
   decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities  leftist
   professors were vigorous proponents of academic freedom  but today  in
   those universities where leftists have become dominant  they have
   shown themselves ready to take away from everyone else's academic
   freedom   this is "political correctness "  the same will happen with
   leftists and technology: they will use it to oppress everyone else if
   they ever get it under their own control 
   
        in earlier revolutions  leftists of the most power-hungry type 
   repeatedly  have first cooperated with non-leftist revolutionaries  as
   well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination  and later
   have double-crossed them to seize power for themselves  robespierre
   did this in the french revolution  the bolsheviks did it in the
   russian revolution  the communists did it in spain in      and castro
   and his followers did it in cuba  given the past history of leftism 
   it would be utterly foolish for non-leftist revolutionaries today to
   collaborate with leftists 
   
        various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of
   religion  leftism is not a religion in the strict sense because
   leftist doctrine does not postulate the existence of any supernatural
   being  but for the leftist  leftism plays a psychological role much
   like that which religion plays for some people  the leftist needs to
   believe in leftism  it plays a vital role in his psychological
   economy  his beliefs are not easily modified by logic or facts  he has
   a deep conviction that leftism is morally right with a capital r  and
   that he has not only a right but a duty to impose leftist morality on
   everyone   however  many of the people we are referring to as
   "leftists" do not think of themselves as leftists and would not
   describe their system of beliefs as leftism  we use the term "leftism"
   because we don't know of any better words to designate the spectrum of
   related creeds that includes the feminist  gay rights  political
   correctness  etc   movements  and because these movements have a
   strong affinity with the old left  see paragraphs    -     
   
        leftism is totalitarian force  wherever leftism is in a position
   of power it tends to invade every private corner and force every
   thought into a leftist mold  in part this is because of the
   quasi-religious character of leftism  everything contrary to leftists
   beliefs represents sin  more importantly  leftism is a totalitarian
   force because of the leftists' drive for power  the leftist seeks to
   satisfy his need for power through identification with a social
   movement and he tries to go through the power process by helping to
   pursue and attain the goals of the movement  see paragraph      but no
   matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its goals the
   leftist is never satisfied  because his activism is a surrogate
   activity  see paragraph      that is  the leftist's real motive is not
   to attain the ostensible goals of leftism  in reality he is motivated
   by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a
   social goal     
   
   consequently the leftist is never satisfied with the goals he has
   already attained  his need for the power process leads him always to
   pursue some new goal  the leftist wants equal opportunities for
   minorities  when that is attained he insists on statistical equality
   of achievement by minorities  and as long as anyone harbors in some
   corner of his mind a negative attitude toward some minority  the
   leftist has to re-educated him  and ethnic minorities are not enough 
   no one can be allowed to have a negative attitude toward homosexuals 
   disabled people  fat people  old people  ugly people  and on and on
   and on  it's not enough that the public should be informed about the
   hazards of smoking  a warning has to be stamped on every package of
   cigarettes  then cigarette advertising has to be restricted if not
   banned  the activists will never be satisfied until tobacco is
   outlawed  and after that it will be alco hot then junk food  etc 
   activists have fought gross child abuse  which is reasonable  but now
   they want to stop all spanking  when they have done that they will
   want to ban something else they consider unwholesome  then another
   thing and then another  they will never be satisfied until they have
   complete control over all child rearing practices  and then they will
   move on to another cause 
   
        suppose you asked leftists to make a list of all the things that
   were wrong with society  and then suppose you instituted every social
   change that they demanded  it is safe to say that within a couple of
   years the majority of leftists would find something new to complain
   about  some new social "evil" to correct because  once again  the
   leftist is motivated less by distress at society's ills than by the
   need to satisfy his drive for power by imposing his solutions on
   society 
   
        because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior
   by their high level of socialization  many leftists of the
   over-socialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people
   do  for them the drive for power has only one morally acceptable
   outlet  and that is in the struggle to impose their morality on
   everyone 
   
        leftists  especially those of the oversocialized type  are true
   believers in the sense of eric hoffer's book  "the true believer " but
   not all true believers are of the same psychological type as leftists 
   presumably a truebelieving nazi  for instance is very different
   psychologically from a truebelieving leftist  because of their
   capacity for single-minded devotion to a cause  true believers are a
   useful  perhaps a necessary  ingredient of any revolutionary movement 
   this presents a problem with which we must admit we don't know how to
   deal  we aren't sure how to harness the energies of the true believer
   to a revolution against technology  at present all we can say is that
   no true believer will make a safe recruit to the revolution unless his
   commitment is exclusively to the destruction of technology  if he is
   committed also to another ideal  he may want to use technology as a
   tool for pursuing that other ideal  see paragraphs           
   
        some readers may say  "this stuff about leftism is a lot of crap 
   i know john and jane who are leftish types and they don't have all
   these totalitarian tendencies " it's quite true that many leftists 
   possibly even a numerical majority  are decent people who sincerely
   believe in tolerating others' values  up to a point  and wouldn't want
   to use high-handed methods to reach their social goals  our remarks
   about leftism are not meant to apply to every individual leftist but
   to describe the general character of leftism as a movement  and the
   general character of a movement is not necessarily determined by the
   numerical proportions of the various kinds of people involved in the
   movement 
   
        the people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements
   tend to be leftists of the most power-hungry type because power-hungry
   people are those who strive hardest to get into positions of power 
   once the power-hungry types have captured control of the movement 
   there are many leftists of a gentler breed who inwardly disapprove of
   many of the actions of the leaders  but cannot bring themselves to
   oppose them  they need their faith in the movement  and because they
   cannot give up this faith they go along with the leaders  true  some
   leftists do have the guts to oppose the totalitarian tendencies that
   emerge  but they generally lose  because the power-hungry types are
   better organized  are more ruthless and machiavellian and have taken
   care to build themselves a strong power base 
   
        these phenomena appeared clearly in russia and other countries
   that were taken over by leftists  similarly  before the breakdown of
   communism in the ussr  leftish types in the west would seldom
   criticize that country  if prodded they would admit that the ussr did
   many wrong things  but then they would try to find excuses for the
   communists and begin talking about the faults of the west  they always
   opposed western military resistance to communist aggression  leftish
   types all over the world vigorously protested the u s  military action
   in vietnam  but when the ussr invaded afghanistan they did nothing 
   not that they approved of the soviet actions  but because of their
   leftist faith  they just couldn't bear to put themselves in opposition
   to communism  today  in those of our universities where "political
   correctness" has become dominant  there are probably many leftish
   types who privately disapprove of the suppression of academic freedom 
   but they go along with it anyway 
   
        thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally mild
   and fairly tolerant people by no means prevents leftism as a whole
   form having a totalitarian tendency 
   
        our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness  it is still far
   from clear what we mean by the word "leftist " there doesn't seem to
   be much we can do about this  today leftism is fragmented into a whole
   spectrum of activist movements  yet not all activist movements are
   leftist  and some activist movements  e g    radical environmentalism 
   seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and
   personalities of thoroughly un-leftist types who ought to know better
   than to collaborate with leftists  varieties of leftists fade out
   gradually into varieties of non-leftists and we ourselves would often
   be hard-pressed to decide whether a given individual is or is not a
   leftist  to the extent that it is defined at all  our conception of
   leftism is defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this
   article  and we can only advise the reader to use his own judgment in
   deciding who is a leftist 
   
        but it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing
   leftism  these criteria cannot be applied in a cut and dried manner 
   some individuals may meet some of the criteria without being leftists 
   some leftists may not meet any of the criteria  again  you just have
   to use your judgment 
   
        the leftist is oriented toward largescale collectivism  he
   emphasizes the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of
   society to take care of the individual  he has a negative attitude
   toward individualism  he often takes a moralistic tone  he tends to be
   for gun control  for sex education and other psychologically
   "enlightened" educational methods  for planning  for affirmative
   action  for multiculturalism  he tends to identify with victims  he
   tends to be against competition and against violence  but he often
   finds excuses for those leftists who do commit violence  he is fond of
   using the common catch-phrases of the left like "racism  " "sexism  "
   "homophobia  " "capitalism " "imperialism " "neocolonialism "
   "genocide " "social change " "social justice " "social
   responsibility " maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his
   tendency to sympathize with the following movements: feminism  gay
   rights  ethnic rights  disability rights  animal rights political
   correctness  anyone who strongly sympathizes with all of these
   movements is almost certainly a leftist      
   
        the more dangerous leftists  that is  those who are most
   power-hungry  are often characterized by arrogance or by a dogmatic
   approach to ideology  however  the most dangerous leftists of all may
   be certain oversocialized types who avoid irritating displays of
   aggressiveness and refrain from advertising their leftism  but work
   quietly and unobtrusively to promote collectivist values 
   "enlightened" psychological techniques for socializing children 
   dependence of the individual on the system  and so forth  these
   crypto-leftists  as we may call them  approximate certain bourgeois
   types as far as practical action is concerned  but differ from them in
   psychology  ideology and motivation  the ordinary bourgeois tries to
   bring people under control of the system in order to protect his way
   of life  or he does so simply because his attitudes are conventional 
   the crypto-leftist tries to bring people under control of the system
   because he is a true believer in a collectivistic ideology  the
   crypto-leftist is differentiated from the average leftist of the
   oversocialized type by the fact that his rebellious impulse is weaker
   and he is more securely socialized  he is differentiated from the
   ordinary well-socialized bourgeois by the fact that there is some deep
   lack within him that makes it necessary for him to devote himself to a
   cause and immerse himself in a collectivity  and maybe his
    well-sublimated  drive for power is stronger than that of the average
   bourgeois 
   
   final note
   
        throughout this article we've made imprecise statements and
   statements that ought to have had all sorts of qualifications and
   reservations attached to them  and some of our statements may be
   flatly false  lack of sufficient information and the need for brevity
   made it impossible for us to fomulate our assertions more precisely or
   add all the necessary qualifications  and of course in a discussion of
   this
   
   kind one must rely heavily on intuitive judgment  and that can
   sometimes be wrong  so we don't claim that this article expresses more
   than a crude approximation to the truth 
   
        all the same we are reasonably confident that the general
   outlines of the picture we have painted here are roughly correct  we
   have portrayed leftism in its modern form as a phenomenon peculiar to
   our time and as a symptom of the disruption of the power process  but
   we might possibly be wrong about this  oversocialized types who try to
   satisfy their drive for power by imposing their morality on everyone
   have certainly been around for a long time  but we think that the
   decisive role played by feelings of inferiority  low self-esteem 
   powerlessness  identification with victims by people who are not
   themselves victims  is a peculiarity of modern leftism  identification
   with victims by people not themselves victims can be seen to some
   extent in   th century leftism and early christianity but as far as we
   can make out  symptoms of low self-esteem  etc   were not nearly so
   evident in these movements  or in any other movements  as they are in
   modern leftism  but we are not in a position to assert confidently
   that no such movements have existed prior to modern leftism  this is a
   significant question to which historians ought to give their
   attention 
   
   notes
   
       paragraph     we are asserting that all  or even most  bullies and
   ruthless competitors suffer from feelings of inferiority 
   
       paragraph     during the victorian period many oversocialized
   people suffered from serious psychological problems as a result of
   repressing or trying to repress their sexual feelings  freud
   apparently based his theories on people of this type  today the focus
   of socialization has shifted from sex to aggression 
   
       paragraph     not necessarily including specialists in engineering
   "hard" sciences 
   
       paragraph     there are many individuals of the middle and upper
   classes who resist some of these values  but usually their resistance
   is more or less covert  such resistance appears in the mass media only
   to a very limited extent  the main thrust of propaganda in our society
   is in favor of the stated values 
   
   the main reasons why these values have become  so to speak  the
   official values of our society is that they are useful to the
   industrial system  violence is discouraged because it disrupts the
   functioning of the system  racism is discouraged because ethnic
   conflicts also disrupt the system  and discrimination wastes the
   talent of minority-group members who could be useful to the system 
   poverty must be "cured" because the underclass causes problems for the
   system and contact with the underclass lowers the moral of the other
   classes  women are encouraged to have careers because their talents
   are useful to the system and  more importantly because by having
   regular jobs women become better integrated into the system and tied
   directly to it rather than to their families  this helps to weaken
   family solidarity   the leaders of the system say they want to
   strengthen the family  but they really mean is that they want the
   family to serve as an effective tool for socializing children in
   accord with the needs of the system  we argue in paragraphs       that
   the system cannot afford to let the family or other small-scale social
   groups be strong or autonomous  
   
       paragraph     it may be argued that the majority of people don't
   want to make their own decisions but want leaders to do their thinking
   for them  there is an element of truth in this  people like to make
   their own decisions in small matters  but making decisions on
   difficult  fundamental questions require facing up to psychological
   conflict  and most people hate psychological conflict  hence they tend
   to lean on others in making difficult decisions  the majority of
   people are natural followers  not leaders  but they like to have
   direct personal access to their leaders and participate to some extent
   in making difficult decisions  at least to that degree they need
   autonomy 
   
       paragraph     some of the symptoms listed are similar to those
   shown by caged animals 
   
   to explain how these symptoms arise from deprivation with respect to
   the power process:
   
   common-sense understanding of human nature tells one that lack of
   goals whose attainment requires effort leads to boredom and that
   boredom  long continued  often leads eventually to depression  failure
   to obtain goals leads to frustration and lowering of self-esteem 
   frustration leads to anger  anger to aggression  often in the form of
   spouse or child abuse  it has been shown that long-continued
   frustration commonly leads to depression and that depression tends to
   cause guilt  sleep disorders  eating disorders and bad feelings about
   oneself  those who are tending toward depression seek pleasure as an
   antidote  hence insatiable hedonism and excessive sex  with
   perversions as a means of getting new kicks  boredom too tends to
   cause excessive pleasure-seeking since  lacking other goals  people
   often use pleasure as a goal  see accompanying diagram  the foregoing
   is a simplification  reality is more complex  and of course
   deprivation with respect to the power process is not the only cause of
   the symptoms described  by the way  when we mention depression we do
   not necessarily mean depression that is severe enough to be treated by
   a psychiatrist  often only mild forms of depression are involved  and
   when we speak of goals we do not necessarily mean long-term  thought
   out goals  for many or most people through much of human history  the
   goals of a hand-to-mouth existence  merely providing oneself and one's
   family with food from day to day  have been quite sufficient 
   
       paragraph     a partial exception may be made for a few passive 
   inward looking groups  such as the amish  which have little effect on
   the wider society  apart from these  some genuine small-scale
   communities do exist in america today  for instance  youth gangs and
   "cults"  everyone regards them as dangerous  and so they are  because
   the members of these groups are loyal primarily to one another rather
   than to the system  hence the system cannot control them  or take the
   gypsies  the gypsies commonly get away with theft and fraud because
   their loyalties are such that they can always get other gypsies to
   give testimony that "proves" their innocence  obviously the system
   would be in serious trouble if too many people belonged to such
   groups  some of the early-  th century chinese thinkers who were
   concerned with modernizing china recognized the necessity of breaking
   down small-scale social groups such as the family: " according to sun
   yat-sen  the chinese people needed a new surge of patriotism  which
   would lead to a transfer of loyalty from the family to the state   
     according to li huang  traditional attachments  particularly to the
   family had to be abandoned if nationalism were to develop to china "
    chester c  tan  chinese political thought in the twentieth century "
   page      page      
   
       paragraph     yes  we know that   th century america had its
   problems  and serious ones  but for the sake of breviety we have to
   express ourselves in simplified terms 
   
       paragraph     we leave aside the underclass  we are speaking of
   the mainstream 
   
        paragraph     some social scientists  educators  "mental health"
   professionals and the like are doing their best to push the social
   drives into group   by trying to see to it that everyone has a
   satisfactory social life 
   
        paragraphs         is the drive for endless material acquisition
   really an artificial creation of the advertising and marketing
   industry? certainly there is no innate human drive for material
   acquisition  there have been many cultures in which people have
   desired little material wealth beyond what was necessary to satisfy
   their basic physical needs  australian aborigines  traditional mexican
   peasant culture  some african cultures   on the other hand there have
   also been many pre-industrial cultures in which material acquisition
   has played an important role  so we can't claim that today's
   acquisition-oriented culture is exclusively a creation of the
   advertising and marketing industry  but it is clear that the
   advertising and marketing industry has had an important part in
   creating that culture  the big corporations that spend millions on
   advertising wouldn't be spending that kind of money without solid
   proof that they were getting it back in increased sales  one member of
   fc met a sales manager a couple of years ago who was frank enough to
   tell him  "our job is to make people buy things they don't want and
   don't need " he then described how an untrained novice could present
   people with the facts about a product  and make no sales at all  while
   a trained and experienced professional salesman would make lots of
   sales to the same people  this shows that people are manipulated into
   buying things they don't really want 
   
        paragraph     the problem of purposelessness seems to have become
   less serious during the last    years or so  because people now feel
   less secure physically and economically than they did earlier  and the
   need for security provides them with a goal  but purposelessness has
   been replaced by frustration over the difficulty of attaining
   security  we emphasize the problem of purposelessness because the
   liberals and leftists would wish to solve our social problems by
   having society guarantee everyone's security  but if that could be
   done it would only bring back the problem of purposelessness  the real
   issue is not whether society provides well or poorly for people's
   security  the trouble is that people are dependent on the system for
   their security rather than having it in their own hands  this  by the
   way  is part of the reason why some people get worked up about the
   right to bear arms  possession of a gun puts that aspect of their
   security in their own hands 
   
        paragraph     conservatives' efforts to decrease the amount of
   government regulation are of little benefit to the average man  for
   one thing  only a fraction of the regulations can be eliminated
   because most regulations are necessary  for another thing  most of the
   deregulation affects business rather than the average individual  so
   that its main effect is to take power from the government and give it
   to private corporations  what this means for the average man is that
   government interference in his life is replaced by interference from
   big corporations  which may be permitted  for example  to dump more
   chemicals that get into his water supply and give him cancer  the
   conservatives are just taking the average man for a sucker  exploiting
   his resentment of big government to promote the power of big business 
   
   
        paragraph     when someone approves of the purpose for which
   propaganda is being used in a given case  he generally calls it
   "education" or applies to it some similar euphemism  but propaganda is
   propaganda regardless of the purpose for which it is used 
   
        paragraph     we are not expressing approval or disapproval of
   the panama invasion  we only use it to illustrate a point 
   
        paragraph     when the american colonies were under british rule
   there were fewer and less effective legal guarantees of freedom than
   there were after the american constitution went into effect  yet there
   was more personal freedom in pre-industrial america  both before and
   after the war of independence  than there was after the industrial
   revolution took hold in this country  we quote from "violence in
   america: historical and comparative perspectives " edited by hugh
   davis graham and ted robert gurr  chapter    by roger lane  pages
      -   : "the progressive heightening of standards of property  and
   with it the increasing reliance on official law enforcement  in   th
   century america      were common to the whole society      t he change
   in social behavior is so long term and so widespread as to suggest a
   connection with the most fundamental of contemporary social processes 
   that of industrial urbanization itself     "massachusetts in      had
   a population of some             percent rural  overwhelmingly
   preindustrial and native born  it's citizens were used to considerable

   social concern     "but the impact of the twin movements to the city
   and to the factory  both just gathering force in       had a
   progressive effect on personal behavior throughout the   th century
   and into the   th  the factory demanded regularity of behavior  a life
   governed by obedience to the rhythms of clock and calendar  the
   demands of foreman and supervisor  in the city or town  the needs of
   living in closely packed neighborhoods inhibited many actions
   previously unobjectionable 
   
   both blue- and white-collar employees in larger establishments were
   mutually dependent on their fellows  as one man's work fit into
   another's  so one man's business was no longer his own  "the results
   of the new organization of life and work were apparent by       when
   some    percent of the           inhabitants of massachusetts were
   classified as urbanites  much violent or irregular behavior which had
   been tolerable in a casual  independent society was no longer
   acceptable in the more formalized  cooperative atmosphere of the later
   period     the move to the cities had  in short  produced a more
   tractable  more socialized  more 'civilized' generation than its
   predecessors "
   
        paragraph      apologists for the system are fond of citing cases
   in which elections have been decided by one or two votes  but such
   cases are rare 
   
        paragraph      "today  in technologically advanced lands  men
   live very similar lives in spite of geographical  religious and
   political differences  the daily lives of a christian bank clerk in
   chicago  a buddhist bank clerk in tokyo  a communist bank clerk in
   moscow are far more alike than the life any one of them is like that
   of any single man who lived a thousand years ago  these similarities
   are the result of a common technology     " l  sprague de camp  "the
   ancient engineers " ballentine edition  page    
   
   the lives of the three bank clerks are not identical  ideology does
   have some effect  but all technological societies  in order to
   survive  must evolve along approximately the same trajectory 
   
        paragraph      just think an irresponsible genetic engineer might
   create a lot of terrorists 
   
        paragraph      for a further example of undesirable consequences
   of medical progress  suppose a reliable cure for cancer is discovered 
   even if the treatment is too expensive to be available to any but the
   elite  it will greatly reduce their incentive to stop the escape of
   carcinogens into the environment 
   
        paragraph      since many people may find paradoxical the notion
   that a large number of good things can add up to a bad thing  we will
   illustrate with an analogy  suppose mr  a is playing chess with mr  b 
   mr  c  a grand master  is looking over mr  a's shoulder  mr  a of
   course wants to win his game  so if mr  c points out a good move for
   him to make  he is doing mr  a a favor  but suppose now that mr  c
   tells mr  a how to make all of his moves  in each particular instance
   he does mr  a a favor by showing him his best move  but by making all
   of his moves for him he spoils the game  since there is not point in
   mr  a's playing the game at all if someone else makes all his moves 
   
   the situation of modern man is analogous to that of mr  a  the system
   makes an individual's life easier for him in innumerable ways  but in
   doing so it deprives him of control over his own fate 
   
        paragraph      here we are considering only the conflict of
   values within the mainstream  for the sake of simplicity we leave out
   of the picture "outsider" values like the idea that wild nature is
   more important than human economic welfare 
   
        paragraph      self-interest is not necessarily material
   self-interest  it can consist in fulfillment of some psychological
   need  for example  by promoting one's own ideology or religion 
   
        paragraph      a qualification: it is in the interest of the
   system to permit a certain prescribed degree of freedom in some areas 
   for example  economic freedom  with suitable limitations and
   restraints  has proved effective in promoting economic growth  but
   only planned  circumscribed  limited freedom is in the interest of the
   system  the individual must always be kept on a leash  even if the
   leash is sometimes long  see paragraphs         
   
        paragraph      we don't mean to suggest that the efficiency or
   the potential for survival of a society has always been inversely
   proportional to the amount of pressure or discomfort to which the
   society subjects people  that is certainly not the case  there is good
   reason to believe that many primitive societies subjected people to
   less pressure than the european society did  but european society
   proved far more efficient than any primitive society and always won
   out in conflicts with such societies because of the advantages
   conferred by technology 
   
        paragraph      if you think that more effective law enforcement
   is unequivocally good because it suppresses crime  then remember that
   crime as defined by the system is not necessarily what you would call
   crime  today  smoking marijuana is a "crime " and  in some places in
   the u s    so is possession of any firearm  registered or not  may be
   made a crime  and the same thing may happen with disapproved methods
   of child-rearing  such as spanking  in some countries  expression of
   dissident political opinions is a crime  and there is no certainty
   that this will never happen in the u s   since no constitution or
   political system lasts forever 
   
   if a society needs a large  powerful law enforcement establishment 
   then there is something gravely wrong with that society  it must be
   subjecting people to severe pressures if so many refuse to follow the
   rules  or follow them only because forced  many societies in the past
   have gotten by with little or no formal law-enforcement 
   
        paragraph      to be sure  past societies have had means of
   influencing behavior  but these have been primitive and of low
   effectiveness compared with the technological means that are now being
   developed 
   
        paragraph      however  some psychologists have publicly
   expressed opinions indicating their contempt for human freedom  and
   the mathematician claude shannon was quoted in omni  august       as
   saying  "i visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to
   humans  and i'm rooting for the machines "
   
        paragraph      this is no science fiction! after writing
   paragraph     we came across an article in scientific american
   according to which scientists are actively developing techniques for
   identifying possible future criminals and for treating them by a
   combination of biological and psychological means  some scientists
   advocate compulsory application of the treatment  which may be
   available in the near future   see "seeking the criminal element"  by
   w  wayt gibbs  scientific american  march        maybe you think this
   is ok because the treatment would be applied to those who might become
   drunk drivers  they endanger human life too   then perhaps to peel who
   spank their children  then to environmentalists who sabotage logging
   equipment  eventually to anyone whose behavior is inconvenient for the
   system 
   
        paragraph      a further advantage of nature as a counter-ideal
   to technology is that  in many people  nature inspires the kind of
   reverence that is associated with religion  so that nature could
   perhaps be idealized on a religious basis  it is true that in many
   societies religion has served as a support and justification for the
   established order  but it is also true that religion has often
   provided a basis for rebellion  thus it may be useful to introduce a
   religious element into the rebellion against technology  the more so
   because western society today has no strong religious foundation 
   
   religion  nowadays either is used as cheap and transparent support for
   narrow  short-sighted selfishness  some conservatives use it this
   way   or even is cynically exploited to make easy money  by many
   evangelists   or has degenerated into crude irrationalism
    fundamentalist protestant sects  "cults"   or is simply stagnant
    catholicism  main-line protestantism   the nearest thing to a strong 
   widespread  dynamic religion that the west has seen in recent times
   has been the quasi-religion of leftism  but leftism today is
   fragmented and has no clear  unified inspiring goal 
   
   thus there is a religious vaccuum in our society that could perhaps be
   filled by a religion focused on nature in opposition to technology 
   but it would be a mistake to try to concoct artificially a religion to
   fill this role  such an invented religion would probably be a failure 
   take the "gaia" religion for example  do its adherents really believe
   in it or are they just play-acting? if they are just play-acting their
   religion will be a flop in the end 
   
   it is probably best not to try to introduce religion into the conflict
   of nature vs  technology unless you really believe in that religion
   yourself and find that it arouses a deep  strong  genuine response in
   many other people 
   
        paragraph      assuming that such a final push occurs 
   conceivably the industrial system might be eliminated in a somewhat
   gradual or piecemeal fashion   see paragraphs        and note    
   
        paragraph      it is even conceivable  remotely  that the
   revolution might consist only of a massive change of attitudes toward
   technology resulting in a relatively gradual and painless
   disintegration of the industrial system  but if this happens we'll be
   very lucky  it's far more probably that the transition to a
   nontechnological society will be very difficult and full of conflicts
   and disasters 
   
        paragraph      the economic and technological structure of a
   society are far more important than its political structure in
   determining the way the average man lives  see paragraphs         and
   notes         
   
        paragraph      this statement refers to our particular brand of
   anarchism  a wide variety of social attitudes have been called
   "anarchist " and it may be that many who consider themselves
   anarchists would not accept our statement of paragraph      it should
   be noted  by the way  that there is a nonviolent anarchist movement
   whose members probably would not accept fc as anarchist and certainly
   would not approve of fc's violent methods 
   
        paragraph      many leftists are motivated also by hostility  but
   the hostility probably results in part from a frustrated need for
   power 
   
        paragraph      it is important to understand that we mean someone
   who sympathizes with these movements as they exist today in our
   society  one who believes that women  homosexuals  etc   should have
   equal rights is not necessarily a leftist  the feminist  gay rights 
   etc   movements that exist in our society have the particular
   ideological tone that characterizes leftism  and if one believes  for
   example  that women should have equal rights it does not necessarily
   follow that one must sympathize with the feminist movement as it
   exists today 
   
   if copyright problems make it impossible for this long quotation to be
   printed  then please change note    to read as follows:
   
        paragraph     when the american colonies were under british rule
   there were fewer and less effective legal guarantees of freedom than
   there were after the american constitution went into effect  yet there
   was more personal freedom in pre-industrial america  both before and
   after the war of independence  than there was after the industrial
   revolution took hold in this country  in "violence in america:
   historical and comparative perspectives " edited by hugh davis graham
   and ted robert gurr  chapter    by roger lane  it is explained how in
   pre-industrial america the average person had greater independence and
   autonomy than he does today  and how the process of industrialization
   necessarily led to the restriction of personal freedom
